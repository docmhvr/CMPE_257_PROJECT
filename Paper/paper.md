# Abstract
Debate over climate change is contentious, particularly in the US, where many people reject the idea that human activity is causing it. It is critical to understand what causes the warming to better combat it because the consequences are predicted to be severe, including a mass extinction of marine life and frequent extreme weather events. The first challenge in this study is how to build trustworthy statistical models based on the collected climate data from the past 3 years and precisely capture temperature. We evaluated the performance of several widely used machine learning algorithms on our data, including Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks in order to build the model for confirming temperature change and identifying the contributing factors. The result should be assessed using numerals that considers a variety of additional factors, such as the highest and lowest possible temperatures, the highest and lowest pressures at sea level, the humidity, the visibility, the average wind speed, the maximum sustained wind speed, fog, and other variables
