# Project Title

Climate Change Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Description

Purpose of this project aims to predict the yearly temperature change of a given city over a given time period. The output value should be numerically based on multiple extra factors like maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, and rain or snow precipitation, storm, tornado and wind speed
